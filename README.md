# TOPS
TOPS (Traverser of Planar Surfaces) is a 3D-printed Open Source Quadrupedal Robot. 
Spelled backwards, “TOPS” becomes “SPOT”, which is the name of the Boston Dynamics robot that inspired this project. 
Over the years, I have made several robot dogs but nothing that has come close to having the natural gait of an actual dog.
In this project, I plan on tackling this challenge head-on
